/*
Recall how a group of children (say c1, c2, . . . , cp) playing hide-and-seek choose the thief. They stand in a
circle, and one particular child ck (called the counter, say) recites some kind of a rhyme consisting of m â‰¥ 1
words, starting with himself / herself and moving on to the next child (ck+1, ck+2, . . . in order) after reciting
each word. Because the children are standing in a circle, the counter moves to c1 after reaching cp. The child
at whom the rhyme ends is eliminated from subsequent rounds of counting. Counting for the next round starts
from the child following the eliminated child (in the circular order described above). The process continues
until one child remains.
Write a program to simulate the above activity, and to determine the order in which children are eliminated.
Input format: An integer (say n) specifying the number of test cases, followed by n lines, each of which
corresponds to a test case. These lines will each consist of 3 integers, corresponding to the total number
of children (p), the serial number of the child chosen as the counter (k), and the length of the rhyme (m),
respectively. Note that numbering of children starts from 1.
Output format: Your program should print the serial numbers of the children in the order in which they are
eliminated, and finish with the number of the child who becomes the thief. For each test case, your program
should print the output in a single line.
Sample input 1:
3
4 1 10
5 2 6
5 2 3
Sample output 1:
2 3 1 4
2 4 3 1 5
4 2 1 3 5
Sample input 2:
4
14 1 10
15 2 4
15 3 2
20 1 1
Sample output 2:
10 6 3 1 14 2 5 9 4 13 8 11 7 12
5 9 13 2 7 12 3 10 1 11 6 4 8 15 14
4 6 8 10 12 14 1 3 7 11 15 5 13 9 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
